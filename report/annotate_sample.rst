--------------------------------------------------

This file (`{{ snakemake.output[0] }}`) contains the per‚Äêsample annotation for reads matched
against the reference genome.  It was generated by the `annotate.pl` script and includes:

- **Genomic coordinates** of each matched marker
- **Gene annotations** (ID, type, synonyms) from GFF3
- **Distance to nearest TSS** and TSS metadata
- **CpG island overlap** and GC content
- **Repeat region overlap** and repeat class
