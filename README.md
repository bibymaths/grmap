A lightweight Snakemake pipeline for mapping sequencing reads to a reference genome and annotating them with genomic features.

---

## Overview

The pipeline performs two main steps:

1. **Matching** reads to a reference genome
2. **Annotating** matches with gene, TSS, CpG, and repeat element data

It is fully configurable via a single `config.yaml` file.
